# MyReads Project

*Udacity’s React Nanodegree project* <br/>

This bookshelf app allows users to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that it should be persisted information as user’s interacts with the application. 

You can see the live demo **[here](https://attilakasza.com/react-myreads/)**

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
